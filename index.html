I needed to insert quality into the development and release processes in order to increase both internal and external confidence in the product. To achieve this I introduced an issue tracking system, used this to introduce quality gates before and after development activities, then automated a proportion of the test suite against the product's REST server. The improved specifications received by the developers meant that the right work was carried out with fewer corrections while the new test process caught a number of issues that otherwise may have been released. </p></div><!-- end ngRepeat: para in role.description track by $index --><div ng-repeat="para in role.description track by $index" ng-bind-html-unsafe="para" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><p ng-bind-html="trustedHtml" class="ng-binding">During the run-up to a major release there was not enough back-end resource to meet the schedule. To remedy this I worked a split role between testing and development, in which I developed a django micro-service which delivered GCM and APNS push notifications. In doing this I familiarised myself with the back-end architecture, and was able to assess the unit testing practices that were in use. This lead to a more detailed understanding of the system as a whole, feeding back into my test strategy.</p></div><!-- end ngRepeat: para in role.description track by $index --><div ng-repeat="para in role.description track by $index" ng-bind-html-unsafe="para" class="ng-scope ng-isolate-scope"><p ng-bind-html="trustedHtml" class="ng-binding">There was nothing in place for continual process improvement; I felt that sequential improvements to the development process would feed into better quality and a faster turn-around of deliverables.
