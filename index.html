                <p>
                    In my professional life I am enthusiastic about making high quality software.

                    My proven track-record and history in QA has led to me being called upon as the person who will quickly pick up a new technology or solve complex problems.

                    This frequently sees me moved into projects looking for either my depth of python knowledge or my breadth of experience.

                    I am looking for a workplace where I am a senior member of a creative, innovative team in which I can work with my colleagues to craft products of the highest quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a lifelong passion for building software which has translated into an active membership of various communities.

                    As part of the <a href="http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/">London Python Dojo</a> team I help less experienced python developers, practice leadership, encourage best practices such as TDD, and build relationships within the python community.

                    Wishing to extend this to to long-form projects, and not seeing anything similar already out there, I founded the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Python-Project-Nights">London Python Project Nights</a> meetup.

                    During this time I have worked on <a href="https://github.com/london-python-project-nights/romaine">Romaine</a>, a BDD framework.

                    My involvement in the python community exemplifies my approach to creating software in a collaborative, encouraging and open environment.

                        I have delivered multiple projects within ambitious timelines.

                        One example of this was learning clojure alongside a mature codebase and delivering a new set of endpoints within a month in order to satisfy a key client.

                        As a result of this I have become the go-to engineer for multiple codebases in multiple languages.

                        I have cleaned up and taken ownership of large legacy codebases in the absence of the original contributors, maintaining <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/vcmf6i3h9nym/1445819/history">100% uptime</a>.

                        With my previous experience in QA I have designed data pipelines with an eye towards validation and testing.

                        I approach challenging projects confidently and competently, ensuring a high level of performance and reliability.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My recognised technical expertise and ability to solve complex problems within tight deadlines has earned me strategic influence within the wider tech team.

                        This extends to product managers where I have been able to set realistic delivery deadlines, with a discussion of what features were imperative, and what could be delayed in order to meet other business pressures.

                        To guarantee that projects were properly deployed, coded to a high standard, and rigorously tested, I have taken a DevOps approach.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        My technical excellence, strategic overview, and <span>ability to take ownership of complex challenges that involve working across multiple technologies and departments</span> means that at present my role is focused on working with the most important clients to ensure delivery of critical features.

                        I am keen to expand this to take more of a leadership role alongside development in my next position.

                            I introduced QA at JustYoyo, a young startup in mobile payments.

                            I inserted quality into the development and release processes, increasing both internal and external confidence in the product.

                            I implemented an issue tracking system, used this to introduce quality gates before and after development activities, then automated a proportion of the test suite against the product's REST server.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked a split role between testing and development during the run-up to a major release, developing a django micro-service which delivered GCM and APNS push notifications.

                            In doing this I familiarised myself with the back-end architecture, and was able to assess the unit testing practices that were in use.

                            This lead to a more detailed understanding of the system as a whole, feeding back into my test strategy.

                        As a progression from my first role at Mind Candy I brought quality into the tools development process, and streamlined manual tasks for greater efficiency.

                        I created new background services to integrate first and third party tools.

                        This reduced workload, removed manual steps and shortened iteration times.

                        I introduced BDD to the team, and formulated system-level tests for their web applications.

                        For this I developed a new test framework: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fattoush">Fattoush</a>.

                        This streamlined test creation and made test deployment more reliable by allowing the same tests to be run either locally, or in parallel across an number of differing remote webdriver sessions, with a simple configuration change.

                            Initially my task was to manage contractors, using Eggplant.

                            I put together a business case for a system which used Sikuli and Selenium in place of Eggplant, and a custom tool for intercepting traffic between the web front end and the back end.

                            I implemented this myself resulting in more stable and easier to maintain tests.

                            For this I developed two systems, of which one was chosen by the development team.

                            The tests written within this system were integrated with the CI server, providing continuous testing on commit.
