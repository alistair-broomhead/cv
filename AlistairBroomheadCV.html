At JustYoyo I introduced a formal QA process, including implementing an issue tracker to hold epics, features and stories as well as test cases, bugs and requests. I then used this to create a workflow in which all features were reviewed before they were broken down into stories with input from the developers. This helped to ensure that by the time work was started on a feature, there was much more certainty as to what the product owners wished the developers to implement, and there was no longer a frequent wish to change stories which were already in progress.
                </p>

                <p>
In addition to this, and the day to day testing work, I designed deployment gateways which mandated levels of testing, including the use of automation, in order to reduce the frequency with which app builds with large-scale compatibility issues would be released to the public.

At the end of 2013 I moved to the Tools team, expanding my role to encompass other automation such as improvements to our continuous integration process. In this role I have introduced BDD to the rest of the tools team, and introduced new background services to integrate different first and third party tools. These integrations not only reduce workload, but by removing manual steps from workflows help to shorten iteration times around the company. While these tools are generally implemented as simple REST services, designing and implementing them has meant getting more involved in other systems such as configuration management.

Within the first two weeks at Mind Candy my role was expanded from manual testing to include sole responsibility for Test Automation at Mind Candy. Initially this involved managing contractors. It was soon determined that I was able to perform more work at a higher standard on my own. Later I determined that Eggplant was not suitable for a system as dynamic as Moshi Monsters, and so I successfully put together a business case for a system which used Sikuli in place of Eggplant, Selenium to navigate to the Flash page I was testing, and a custom tool for intercepting traffic between the web front end and the back end. I have also spent time developing tests for Unity which could run on-device. For this I developed two systems. One ran within the game itself, with everything running within the Unity runtime. The other ran a client within the game and an external server controlled by the tests.

Originally I was hired as a manual tester, however with many long and error prone manual processes involved before being able to run a test case, I began to script some of these to reduce errors, but also to allow me to spend this setup time looking at the tests and looking for edge cases. Initially I wrote these scripts for my own use, but after my manager and colleagues notices how beneficial they were to my productivity, I was asked to write tools which others could use too. Later I was tasked with the maintenance of a legacy automation suite, extending it to gather performance data, and then converting some of our manual test scripts to CodedUI tests. As this was within a small team these extra responsibilities were always on top of the base role which involved writing and executing test cases and strategies for testing new features or adopting new technologies. For this role I learned MS SQL Server, VSS, TFS, C#, and a host of related technologies, as well as frequently putting myself forward for projects where I could apply and expand my knowledge and skills.

    In this role I was tasked with developing an automated testing project from a broadly defined specification which gave scope to shape the project. The tests were for a network monitoring product using a number of technologies I had never used before including Python, XML, STAF/STAX, bash and Rational Clearcase. At the end of my years placement I then trained a new industrial trainee to continue the work. My placement exceeded the course requirements expected under the SFIA scheme.

From an early age I have wanted to make games. At the age of 11 I bought a simple WYSIWYG program for designing computer games. This lead on to learning various dialects of BASIC, even writing a simple blackjack game on my A level graphical calculator.
            </p>

            <p>
In my working life, both at Mind Candy and before, I have continued to pursue a love, both of playing and making games. Recent projects have included ASCII Boggle and tic-tac-toe games developed as part of a team at London Python Dojo events. In addition to team projects I also develop solo projects, most recently an Android Tetris app.
            </p>

            <p>
In my professional life I am passionate about making high quality software which my roles in QA and Automation have helped achieve. My roles have helped me appreciate that you need to work on quality at every point in the lifecycle of a project, and that high quality tools can not only save effort but enable developers and artists to spend more of their time focussed on high quality content, rather than the machinery of integrating their work into the project.
            </p>

            <p>
I have spent 5 years cultivating excellent professional skills in writing tests and software as well as scripting processes. While this gives me a well rounded skill set in QA Automation I am now looking for a role that will enable me to develop these skills at a higher level.
            </p>

            <p>
As well as keeping informed of industry developments via social media and other subscriptions, I am a member of several BCS specialist groups including the Advanced Programming Group, AI, Animation and Games, Interaction, and Open Source. Through these groups Ive attended talks and meetups which have often introduced me to concepts which later proved useful such as BDD and debugging techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
I have also become heavily involved with the London Python Dojo and am now one of the team of organisers. Even though I am an experienced Python developer, mentoring those who know less enables me to reinforce my own understanding and develop my awareness of my own programming habits in order to improve my development skills across languages. The London Python Dojo has also allowed me to work on non-technical skills such as leadership and communication.
            </p>

            <p>
Within Mind Candy I have pursued opportunities to be a fully involved member of a dynamic and diverse organisation. I organise a weekly board game club which reaches out to colleagues from departments which would not usually work closely together. Another club I am currently involved in started out as a set of tutorials on starting out with Unity; we are now working on a number of games as small groups. In the past I have also been a member of game jam clubs, in which I got to take many different roles in the creation of games which were to be completed within an hour-long lunch break. I have also represented Mind Candy at Tech City recruitment events, including the Silicon Drinkabout and the Silicon Milkroundabout.
            </p>

            <p>
In my spare time I practice Judo and amateur photography, and enjoy tea, craft beers and rare whiskys.
