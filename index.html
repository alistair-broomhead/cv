        I am a passionate, hard-working, highly motivated individual. I am passionate 
        about developing innovative, high-quality software, which has been driven in
        part by my love of computer games. I graduated from one of the top computer
        science departments in the country and have spent 6 years expanding my
        technical skills and experience. I have passion, commitment and ambition
        which I am looking to bring to and develop within an exciting new role.

                <p>
                    I introduced a formal QA process, including implementing an
                    issue tracker to hold the product backlog as well as test
                    cases, bugs and requests. I used this to create a workflow
                    in which all features were reviewed before they were broken
                    down into stories with input from the developers, to ensure
                    more certainty as to what the product owners wished the
                    developers to implement, reducing the frequent wish to
                    change stories which were already in progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I designed deployment gateways which mandated
                    levels of testing, including the use of automation, in order
                    to reduce the frequency with which app builds with
                    large-scale compatibility issues would be released to the
                    public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I implemented fortnightly retrospective meetings, promoted
                    Kanban practices and drove process improvement as part of
                    increasing product quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed the back-end component for a device push
                    service. In doing this I familiarised myself with the
                    back-end architecture, and was able to assess the unit
                    testing practices that were in use. This enabled me to
                    advise on better unit testing practices and gave me
                    insight in to which areas of the system might benefit from
                    extra testing.

                    As a progression of my role I moved to the Tools team to
                    encompass other automation such as improvements to our
                    continuous integration process. In this role I introduced
                    BDD to the tools team, and introduced new background
                    services to integrate different first and third party tools.
                    This reduced workload, removed manual steps and shortened

                    Part of this role involved creating and contributing to open

                    This role included sole responsibility for Test Automation
                    at Mind Candy. Initially this involved managing contractors
                    but I took over the work to improve standards. I put
                    together a business case for a system which used Sikuli and
                    Selenium in place of Eggplant, and a custom tool for
                    intercepting traffic between the web front end and the back
                    end. This resulted in more stable tests.

                    I also spent time developing tests for Unity which could run

                    My base role involved writing and executing test cases and
                    strategies for testing new features or adopting new
                    technologies.
                </p>

                <p>My ability to automate long and error-prone manual processes
                    quickly saw my role expand to include scripting and test
                    automation. I was asked to write tools which others around
                    the business could use. I was tasked with the maintenance of
                    a legacy automation suite, extending it to gather
                    performance data, and then converting some manual test

            <p>
                From an early age I have wanted to make games. At the age of 11
                I bought a simple WYSIWYG program for designing computer games.
                This lead on to learning various dialects of BASIC, even writing
                a simple blackjack game on my A level graphical calculator. I
                have continued to pursue a love, both of playing and making
                games. Recent projects have included ASCII Boggle and
                tic-tac-toe games developed as part of a team at London Python
                Dojo events. In addition to team projects I also develop solo
                projects, including recently an Android Tetris app.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my professional life I am passionate about making high
                quality software. My roles have helped me appreciate that you
                need to work on quality at every point in the lifecycle of a
                project, and that high quality tools can not only save effort
                but enable developers and artists to spend more of their time
                focused on high quality content, rather than the machinery of
                integrating their work into the project. I have spent 6
                years cultivating excellent professional skills in writing
                tests and software as well as scripting processes, driving
                process and quality improvement at every opportunity.
            </p>
                <p>
                    As part of the <a href="http://ldnpydojo.org.uk/">London
                    Python Dojo</a> team I get the opportunity to try out new
                    skills and knowledge. In return I
                    get to help less experienced python developers, and
                    encourage best practices such as TDD, as well as growing
                    close ties with other members of the python community.
                    My involvement in the python community exemplifies my
                    approach to creating software in a collaborative,
                    encouraging and open environment.

                <p>
                    While the London Python Dojo gives me opportunities to use
                    new approaches to technologies, my membership of the BCS
                    allows me to explore these in greater depth. Combining
                    breadth and depth in my understanding of technologies and
                    approaches drives flexibility and creativity in my
                    professional life.

                    Getting involved in hack days, game jams or board game
                    clubs has helped to create collaborative communities of
                    co-workers. In my experience to date I have always thrived
                    in companies with this kind of culture, where strong working
                    relationships help to drive productivity.

                    I am looking for a workplace in which I am a member of a

                    with my colleagues to build a product which we all
                    believe in. I hope to work in this type of open and engaged
                    environment crafting high quality software as part of a
                    highly productive team.
